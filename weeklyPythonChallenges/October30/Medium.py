# Medium: Sales above Average
# For sales analysts, itâ€™s often useful to identify which salespeople or products are performing above average. Given a dictionary of product sales, create a function that identifies products whose sales are above the average sales for all products.

# product_sales = {
#     "Laptop": 1200,
#     "Smartphone": 700,
#     "Tablet": 500,
#     "Headphones": 300,
#     "Smartwatch": 400,
# }
